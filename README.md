:dna: :brain: I have a Masters in Biochemistry from University of Surrey and I specialised in optimising mRNA extraction techniques within learning and memory for my final year project.

:writing_hand: I'm passionate about communicating science to the general public, and am working on my biochemistry blog ('OMICS') when I have spare time!

### My first project with AiCore!
