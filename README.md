:dna: :brain: I have a Masters in Biochemistry from University of Surrey where I specialised in optimising cell-specific mRNA extraction techniques within a sub-set of cortical neurons to explore how different sleep states affect learning and memory.

:snake: :cloud: I completed a Cloud Engineering intensive course with AiCore.

:eagle: :computer: Completed training in Data and Analytics with Peregrine.
