:dna: :brain: I have a Masters in Biochemistry from University of Surrey and I specialised in optimising cell-specific mRNA extraction techniques within a sub-set of cortical neurons to explore how different sleep states affect learning and memory.

:writing_hand: I'm passionate about communicating science to the general public, and am working on my biochemistry blog ('OMICS') when I have spare time!

:snake: :cloud: I'm currently working towards becoming a Cloud Engineer with AiCore.
